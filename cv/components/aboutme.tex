I worked extensively with PHP, specifically the Laravel framework. 

As I delved deeper into web development, I eventually made the switch to Ruby and Ruby on Rails.
Within this tech stack, I've utilized a variety of powerful gems, including Sidekiq, Devise, and Pundit. 
To ensure high-quality code, I used linter Rubocop with extensions Rubocop-Performance and Rubocop-Rails.

I have experience with PosgreSQL as well as MySQL and Redis for caching.
When I was working in analytical company, I specialized in the column-oriented database \href{https://clickhouse.com/}{ClickHouse}.
I also possess strong SQL skills, able to structure and normalize relational databases with ease.

As a Linux user, I'm skilled in bash programming language and have developed a variety
of scripts, which you can check out in my \href{https://github.com/wittyjudge/dotfiles/tree/master/.local/bin}{dotfiles Github repository}.

Have experience in Lua with my \href{https://github.com/WIttyJudge/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/nvim}{neovim config} and that was a fun learning experience.

With my varied technical background, I'm confident that I would be a great fit for the position of Backend Engineer.
